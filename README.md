# QA Recruitment Test
This exercise will check your skills related to automated testing and generic experience in software development.

## Before you start
- Fork this repository, it needs to stay on GitHub, publicly available.
- We are not answering any questions about this test. Everyone work with the same set of information, to let us fairly judge your work.
- You will need a Node.js installed in the current LTS version.

## Setup
Install the project dependencies using `npm install` and then start the app with `npm run dev`.

On [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) you will see an app for exercising writing scripts calculating quadratic equation.

The app is not fully functional, and we don't want you to change that state, so take what you get as a snapshot, showing just a small part of the whole project, in one state.

## Task
We want you to cover this app with tests, it's up to you to pick the right type, scope and number of them.

As a testing framework use Cypress and commit all related code to the repository.
