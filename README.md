# QA Recruitment Test
This exercise will check your skills related to automated testing and generic experience in software development.

## Before you start
- Fork this repository, it needs to stay on GitHub, publicly available.
- We are not answering any questions about this test. Everyone work with the same set of information, to let us fairly judge your work.
- You will need a Node.js installed in the current LTS version (if you don't know where to start, use [Volta](https://volta.sh/)).

## Setup
Clone repo locally and then install the project dependencies using `npm install` and then start the app with `npm run cypress`.

It will open Cypress and generate some sample tests and config file.

## Task
We want you to cover the process of adding products to the cart on https://alpaca-community.snowdog.dev/
Don't make orders, keep things simple, let's assume that you have a budget of up to 4 hours to handle that.

Remember to commit all related code to the repository.
